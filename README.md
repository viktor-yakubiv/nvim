# Viktor Yakubiv's Neovim Configuration

Originally, I wanted to choose an alredy made configuration
and use it as a package, pulling updates from time to time.
However, when I studied repositories tagged with _nvim_ and _neovim_
on GitHub, I discovered that
those configurations are tailored for personal needs
and in general are not built as a package but rather as a whole.
Therefore, I decided to start my own configuration from scratch.

## Acknowledgements

I have been inspired by the following list repositories:

- [jdhao's nvim-config](https://github.com/jdhao/nvim-config)
- [CosmicVim](https://github.com/CosmicNvim/CosmicNvim)
- [AstroNvim](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim)
- [NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad)

I am grateful to all authors and contributors
of these public configurations that made it possible
for me to do something similar.

Thank you ❤️
